<h1>Reflection:</h1>

This project taught me the value of planning before coding. While I didn't use pseudocode initially, I now see how it could have helped structure my thinking, especially for handling edge cases and calculations. As a visual learner, writing out the logic first would have made implementation smoother. Though preparation takes time upfront, it prevents problems later. Moving forward, I'll make pseudocoding a standard practice.
